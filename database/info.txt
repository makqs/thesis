records and record instances - record isntances are basically versions
record instances - PR program, ST stream, CS course, DA dual award
record instances - versions
records - base thing
stream_courses - has status or elective or core (dont use though)
acad_rules - 
records - current_published_isntance gives the current instance for that thing
records - id links to the record_instance table on column record_id
same schema as comp3311 assignment which has an er diagram (should be roughly the same as this)
ACTIVE_OBJECTS VIEW IS REALLY USEFUL - id = record id, instid = record instance id, career(RS) = research so no UOC, NA = non-award, HY = hybrid (courses), downside is doesn't work with older students, could maybe write a version with all the versions (we know the term they took it, and we know the effective and end dates of versions, so work out what term they did it and 
maybe write a view or function that takes a term and course and returns the record
active_rules - tied to records and record instances (raw definition is what i want, not definition)
